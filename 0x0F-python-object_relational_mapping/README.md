Database and Python Integration Project
Background Context
In this project, you will link two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

Project Overview
Part 1: Use the MySQLdb module to connect to a MySQL database and execute SQL queries.
Part 2: Use the SQLAlchemy module, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), to abstract the storage and interact with the database using Python objects instead of SQL queries.
