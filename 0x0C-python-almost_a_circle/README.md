## Learning Objectives

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of several fundamental programming concepts and practices. By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following topics to anyone without needing to rely on external sources:

### 1. Unit Testing

**What is Unit Testing?**
Unit testing is a software testing approach used to verify the functionality of individual units or components of a program. It ensures that each component works as expected in isolation.

**How to Implement Unit Testing in a Large Project**
- Create test cases for each unit or module of your code.
- Utilize testing frameworks, such as PyTest, unittest (for Python), JUnit (for Java), etc.
- Isolate the unit being tested and mock external dependencies.
- Write test functions to verify the unit's behavior and functionality.

### 2. Serialization and Deserialization of a Class

**What is Serialization and Deserialization?**
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted, such as JSON or binary data. Deserialization is the reverse process of converting serialized data back into an object.

**How to Implement Serialization and Deserialization**
In Python, you can use libraries like `pickle` for binary serialization and the `json` module for JSON serialization and deserialization.

### 3. Writing and Reading a JSON File

**How to Write a JSON File**
- Use the `json.dump()` or `json.dumps()` method in Python to convert Python objects to JSON and save it to a file.

**How to Read a JSON File**
- Utilize `json.load()` or `json.loads()` to parse JSON data from a file or a JSON string.

### 4. `*args` and `**kwargs`

**What is `*args`?**
`*args` is used to pass a variable number of non-keyword (positional) arguments to a function. It allows you to pass any number of arguments to the function as a tuple.

**What is `**kwargs`?**
`**kwargs` is used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. It allows you to pass any number of keyword arguments as a dictionary.

### 5. Handling Named Arguments in a Function

**How to Handle Named Arguments in a Function**
In Python, you can handle named arguments in a function by specifying them with default values. These arguments can be called by their names when invoking the function.

```python
def example_function(arg1, named_arg1="default_value", named_arg2="another_default"):
    # arg1 is a positional argument, named_arg1 and named_arg2 are named arguments with default values
i
